            Sorry if this does not look appealing, I did take a web development and Cloud Computing class, but front-end development is not my thing.

            <p>I am a recent graduate from Oregon State University with a degree in Applied Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence.
            In my previous pursuit in Chemistry at University of San Diego, I went back to school for CS.</p>
            <p>I would like to thank some exceptional professors on my journey and it was a privilege to have them:
                Robin Hess for CS 162/261/290/492/493, and Stefan Lee for CS 434
            </p>
            <p>Below is a list of books I have completed or am currently working on (most of these are not for school, but rather as a hobby for broadening my knowledge):</p>

            While attending OSU, I generally would wanted to do assignments by myself, mainly because I want to learn as much as I can. You can request code examples.
            I would write guides for labs, and setting up VSCode environments for simple console applications to debugging JOS kernels.

            Some hobbies include: Running on trails, power lifting, olympic lifting, fixing cars, DIY projects. I occassionally go on long runs to deload from stress.
            In fact, most of my ideas come while running. My method of studying is simply planting the seed of knowledge, then
            go on a long run to think about it.

            I am very much intrigued with reinforced learning. A personal project of making bots in a player-vs-player (playing against other players) and player-vs-environment
            (usually incorporate min-maxing) settings in video games drove me to write successful algorithms. Some optimizations include, as you might imagine, navigation (optimizing
            the shortest distance to a moving object) shortest distance around moving objects from A to B (imagine moving spheres, what is the shortest distance to B as the sphere objects
            move dynamically?), min-maxing against other players (what action would lessen the highest possible success in the opponent?). These are all common problems that Machine
            learning can be used, and video games are a fantastic way to learn how to code these. With over 7 years of experience writing bots, I am glad I started programming through a hobby. Albiet it took longer to learn without learning resources, I still enjoy to see the fruition of my labor.

                Here are some picture of my very early coding years, some of which were from a guide I made long ago:
