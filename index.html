            <p>I am a Computer Science applied AI student at Oregon State Univesity.
            In my previous pursuit in Chemistry at University of San Diego, I went back to school for CS.</p>
            <p>I am currently going through an AI Algorithms book but rewriting all of it using intel compiler (intrinsics), NVIDIA CUDA, OpenCL, MPI, and/or SIMD.
                This is mainly because I want to practice writing parallel programming. Offloading work to the GPU is important for many algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>Below is a list of books I have completed or am currently working on (most of these are not for school, but rather as a hobby for broadening my knowledge):</p>

            Some hobbies include: Running on trails, power lifting, olympic lifting, fixing cars, DIY projects.
            I am currently working on building a standing desk from scratch. My recent achievement in powerlifting was
            a 500lbs deadlift. I occassionally go on long runs to deload from stress. In fact, most of my ideas come while running.
            My method of studying is simply planting the seed of knowledge, then go on a long run to think about it.

            I am very much intrigued with reinforced learning. A personal project of making bots in a player-vs-player (playing against other players) and player-vs-environment 
            (usually incorporate min-maxing) settings in video games drove me to write successful algorithms. Some optimizations include, as you might imagine, navigation (optimizing
            the shortest distance to a moving object) shortest distance around moving objects from A to B (imagine moving spheres, what is the shortest distance to B as the sphere objects
            move dynamically?), min-maxing against other players (what action would lessen the highest possible success in the opponent?). These are all common problems that Machine
            learning can be used, and video games are a fantastic way to learn how to code these. With over 7 years of experience writing bots (starting with basic conditionals to apply
            loss functions), I am glad I started programming through a hobby. Albiet it took longer to learn without learning resources, I still enjoy to see the fruition of my labor.

            I am glad I found a career I enjoy, even though it is 4 years late. I have never been more motivated to succeed, achieving exceptional grades in all my CS classes.
