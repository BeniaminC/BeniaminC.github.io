                    While attending OSU, I generally would do assignments by myself, mainly because I want to learn as much as I can. I would even do unnecessary extra credit. You can request code examples. I would write guides for labs and setting up VSCode environments: from simple console applications to debugging JOS kernels.

                    While I started my higher education studies with an emphasis in Advanced Chemistry, I transitioned to an emphasis in Computer science after developing a passion for AI bots from a programming hobby project. During my pursuit for a Computer Science applied AI degree, I have been involved in helping students succeed. In the unprecedented time of COVID-19, remote learning had negatively impacted the learning experience and the need for interpersonal skills. Ensuring the success of the next generation of programmers requires solidifying foundational knowledge from the ground-up. To mitigate education quality compromises, due to work hour cuts, I voluntarily give back to the engineering by providing one-on-one Zoom meetings and writing extensive repositories for programming languages.

                    Some hobbies include: Running on trails, power lifting, olympic lifting, fixing cars, DIY projects. I occasionally go on long runs to deload from stress.
                    In fact, most of my ideas come while running. My method of studying is simply planting the seed of knowledge, then
                    go on a long run to think about it.

                    I am very much intrigued with reinforced learning. A personal project of making bots in a player-vs-player (playing against other players) and player-vs-environment
                    (usually incorporate min-maxing) settings in video games drove me to write successful algorithms. Some optimizations include, as you might imagine, navigation (optimizing
                    the shortest distance to a moving object) shortest distance around moving objects from A to B (imagine moving spheres, what is the shortest distance to B as the sphere objects
                    move dynamically?), min-maxing against other players (what action would lessen the highest possible success in the opponent?). These are all common problems that Machine
                    learning can be used, and video games are a fantastic way to learn how to code these. With over 7 years of experience writing bots, I am glad I started programming through a hobby. Albeit it took longer to learn without learning resources, I still enjoy to see the fruition of my labor.

                    Unfortunately, my guide has been taken down, and I no longer have access to it. I wished I backed it up somewhere on an old hard-drive. Some featured I remembed it included were:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rotation prioritization behavior callback looping (an array loop of function callbacks)</li>
                        <li>Overhead reduction (reduce overhead by removing duplicate API calls, ordering API calls based on overhead, applying order of filters based on overhead)</li>
                        <li>Automatic movement: target interception, mesh navigation, positioning navigation (i.e. Navigation from A to B, prediction future location, rogue going behind target quickly and effectively, Line of Sight gain/avoidance)</li>
                        <li>Object dynamic programming and information caching (improves performance substantially using hash maps and arrays of pointer objects)</li>
                        <li>Event driven programming (using combat log event unfiltered to update information, which improves performance)</li>
                        <li>String parsing information (gathering information from descriptions, such as "20% more damage". This information is memoized and is used to determine if an object is "dangerous" or "vulnerable")</li>
                        <li>Augmented API (i.e. computing health including damage reduction and absorption. This allows more powerful information in addition to API calls. These augmented values often needed to be computed)</li>
                        <li>Metamethods and metatables (Lua revolves around tables, so creating powerful metamethods are important for object management)</li>
                        <li>Semi-automatic assistance (ability to override automatic rotation, allow rotation to provide options)</li>
                        <li>Robust settings (allow the user to tailor the bot to his/her liking in very precise settings, over 100 different settings, essentially making no two bots the same)</li>
                        <li>Latency computation (compute values based on latency such as state durations and location, Latency is computed from API call).</li>
                        <li>Human-like behavior (perform action to pass Turing test more effectively, such as clicking a location as a normal distribution so as to not perform on an exact location and providing an option to delay response so it doesn't look like the player responds faster than human reflexes)</li>
                        <li>Forecasting (forecast winning and losing using min-max algorithms and react accordingly, such as running away a losing battle or reacting when 'the stars align')</li>
                        <li>Interproccess communication and Coroutines (Behavior bot and rotation bot needs to communicate in sync. Coroutines can achieve this in Lua as non-preemptive multithreading)</li>
                        <li>Hotkey override and customization (allow the bot to be overridden through hotkeys. Hotkeys can be customized to react various ways, such as 'holding down button', 'perform an action for 1 second after a press'. Some hotkeys, for example, can pauses the bot for a specific duration.)</li>
                        <li>Optimized macros (allow the bot the optimize the user input, such as performing an action only if possible and disabling an action if not. A human would often press a button to perform an action only to be countered before he/she can react)</li>
                        <li>Lua object oriented programming to enforce privacy</li>
                        <li>Weak tables to memoize API calls that are static/dynamic, default values, object attributes</li>
                        <li>... and many more! (All without any concept of any programming 'standards' or CS degree)</li>
                    </ul>

                            The image shows circle tangents. The idea is to get to the further wolf, you have to run around the other wolf without "aggro-ing" it. Multiple objects use recursion to find the shortest path to a location. A good heuristic navigation algorithm is known as the A* search algorithm. There are many variants, but because we generally deal with 1-20 objects, it is sufficient.
